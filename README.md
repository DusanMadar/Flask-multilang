# Flask-multilang

A Flask app demonstrating how to create a multi-language website without using `Babel`.

Messages are stored in a simple `JSON` file and you have to provide translations for supported locales yourself.


Check it out here: http://multilang-data295.rhcloud.com. It's running on OpenShift and the app may be idle. It will automatically return to a running state upon an external request, but it will take some time to wake up.
